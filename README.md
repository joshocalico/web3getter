## Our use of Sponsors 

### Lens Protocol. We rely on Lens Protocol to integrate the lens profiles for each My Room page. The Lens Handle is prominently atop the dashboard and we use that handle to check if Users have created a room or not. Users can search for their friend's rooms by resolving to their Lens handles and they can follow each other using the Lens follow integration. My Room's entire social element runs on those fundamental features of Lens but adds the personalized dashboard for each user. We believe the intuitive and sleek UI of My Room will enable web3 to have a better social web3 experience and encourage non-web3 users to socially utilize their NFTs.

### WalletConnect. My Room is a deployed Dapp that integrates Wallet Connect to provide a convenient user experience for onboarding mainstream people into web3. We place a themed wallet connect button on the home page of the dapp to immprove the user interface. We rely extensively on Wallet Connect to provide quick access to multiple wallets across multiple chains. The wallet connect themed QR pop-up emphasizes the importance of connecting a wallet but relaxes the user with the use of the orange color.
