# My Room

My Room enables people to collect, share, and utilize their NFTs in a secure a manner with an intuitive and sleek UI built for the mainstream user. Let's unlock your NFT potential. 

## Our use of Sponsors 

### Lens Protocol. 
My Room relies on Lens Protocol to integrate the lens profiles for each My Room page. The Lens Handle is prominently atop the dashboard and we use that handle to check if Users have created a room or not. Users can search for their friend's rooms by resolving to their Lens handles and they can follow each other using the Lens follow integration. My Room's entire social element runs on those fundamental features of Lens but adds the personalized dashboard for each user. We believe the intuitive and sleek UI of My Room will enable web3 to have a better social web3 experience and encourage non-web3 users to socially utilize their NFTs.

### WalletConnect. 
My Room is a deployed Dapp that integrates Wallet Connect to provide a convenient user experience for onboarding mainstream people into web3. We place a themed wallet connect button on the home page of the dapp to immprove the user interface. We rely extensively on Wallet Connect to provide quick access to multiple wallets across multiple chains. The wallet connect themed QR pop-up emphasizes the importance of connecting a wallet but relaxes the user with the use of the orange color.

### Base.
Our target user are mainstream users who are unfamiliar with web3. Deploying on Base means that users can enter the convenient ecosystem of Coinbase and potentially begin to use Coinbase's financial services and NFT marketplace because of their use of My Room. Each profile is a mintable ERC-721 contract. Each profile resolves to the minter's address. We deployed the ERC-721 contract on Base testnet because we wanted to enable the user to resolve to their addresses. The ERC-721 is an easy and fast way for users to share their room profiles and to save the content of their room profiles to the token URI.
